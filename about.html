            <h4>Script Editior and Gingerbread Organizer, A Gingerbread Christmas (2022)</h4>
            <p>Working under gingerbread artist <a href="http://cakesbybeatriz.com/ginerneers">Beatriz Muller</a>, I
                joined
                the crew for the movie
                <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21821424/">A Gingerbread Christmas</a> premiering November 11,
                2022 on
                Discovery+.
                I was tasked with going through the script, making note of all inconsistencies and providing alternative
                ideas for Beatriz to present at meetings.
                Once the script was finalized, I organized and directed a team of artists to ensure that every piece
                present
                in the script was prepared exactly as requested.
                I packaged all completed pieces, labeling each one with the exact scenes they belonged to.
