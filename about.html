                            Muller</a>, I
                        joined
                        the crew for the movie
                        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21821424/">A Gingerbread Christmas</a> which premiered
                        November 11,
                        2022 on
                        Discovery+.
                        I was tasked with going through the script, making note of all inconsistencies and providing
                        alternative
                        ideas for Beatriz to present at meetings.
                        Once the script was finalized, I organized and directed a team of artists to ensure that every
                        piece
                        present
                        in the script was prepared exactly as requested.
                        I packaged all completed pieces, labeling each one with the exact scenes they belonged to.

            <h3>EB Games - 2016 to 2021</h3>
            <p>From Sales Associate to Store Manager</p>

            <div class="ebgames">
                <h4>Sales Associate/Keyholder - Sept 2016 to Aug 2019</h4>
                <p>I was hired at EB Games in 2016 as a sales associate providing excellent customer service by selling
                    video games, accessories, warranties, loyalty cards and loot.
                    I handled financial transactions including cash, debit and credit as well as trade ins.
                    Approximately 3 months into the job I was given the position of Keyholder.
                    I was responsible for opening and closing the store, ordering supplies, accurately processing
                    shipping and receiving, and maintaining merchandise.
                    During this time I consistently remained a top performer in sales by building rapport with
                    customers.
                    Approximately 1 year into the job, I took on the role of acting Assistant Manager.
                    I maintained this roll for 2 years, helping out in multiple locations, before getting promoted to
                    Assistant Manager.
                </p>

                <h4>Assistant Manager - Aug 2019 to July 2020</h4>
                <p>As an Assistant Manager, I was responsible for many things including hiring and training employees,
                    carrying out coaching plans, and executing write ups.
                    I became skilled at resolving customer issues by going above and beyond to ensure customer
                    satisfaction while maintaining company policy.
                    I collaborated with Sony and Nintendo representatives for marketing and special events such as
                    Pokemon card release days or midnight lauches for games.
                    I planned, organized, directed and evaluated not only daily operations, but every event as well.
                    Customers claimed that my midnight lauches were some of the most fun launches they experienced in
                    years!
                    When I wasn't on the floor talking to customers, I was attending conference calls, handling and
                    logging paperwork, preparing weekly marketing,
                    and executing visual merchandising.

                <h4>Store Manager - July 2020 to April 2021</h4>
                <p>I became a store manager during the pandemic and was given a store that was not performing well.
                    I retrained the staff, hired new staff, re-merchandised the entire store, organized paperwork, and
                    brought the store metrics up to company standard.
                    During this time, I also helped out to run another store who didn't have a manager while also
                    helping to train the Assistant Manager.
                    As a manager, I learned a lot about the importance of having good relationships with staff to ensure
                    a good working environment,
                    how to work with different personality types, and how to delegate tasks that maximized efficiency
                    within each persons skill set.
